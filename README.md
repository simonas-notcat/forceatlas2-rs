# ForceAtlas2 Rust

Implementation of [ForceAtlas2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4051631/) &#8211; force-directed Continuous Graph Layout Algorithm for Handy Network Visualization (i.e. position the nodes of a n-dimension graph for drawing it more human-readably)

![Example graph spacialized with ForceAtlas2-rs](https://txmn.tk/img/wot-fa2rs.png)

## Examples

[Install Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and switch to nightly:

    rustup toolchain install nightly && rustup default nightly

Clone repository:

    git clone https://framagit.org/ZettaScript/forceatlas2-rs && cd forceatlas2-rs

The file `examples/wot.csv` lists the edges of a directed graph, in two columns.

### GTK viewer

Interactive viewer. You need GTK installed.

    cargo run --release -p viz -- examples/wot.csv

## Bindings

There is a binding for use in Python, [fa2rs](https://framagit.org/ZettaScript/fa2rs-py).

## Improvements

Previous versions of this crate were using hand-written AVX2 code to speed up repulsion by 16. It was however still O(N^2). Now the only implementation of repulsion uses the Barnes-Hut algorithm (quadtree/octree, O(NlogN)), which makes any kind of parallelization harder (SIMD, multithreading, GPU). Some research papers describe ways to parallelize quadtree building or even to implement it using SIMD or GPU.
